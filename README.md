# Stock Analysis with VBA

## Overview of Project

### Purpose and Background
In this project we wanted to help Steve analyze the entire dataset to see which green stocks he may want to invest in and how they have performed over the year 2017 and 2018. For the challenge, they wanted us to refactor the code so it was a bit more efficient for if Steve introduces more stocks that he wants to analyze.
## Analysis and Results

### Analysis of Green Stocks
In this excercise we set up our VBA code to run through the analysis of 12 different tickers. We were able to set up buttons for Steve and prompts to ask him if he wanted to analyze the 2017 data or if he wanted to analyze to 2018 data. We did this with the coding of for loops, if/then statements, and setting variables, and formatting.

We were able to give him a good look at how stocks were performing over the years in an easy to see reference table with green or red backgrounds depending on if they were profitable or if they were down on the year.

### Analysis of Refactoring VBA code
In this analysis, we were given a more efficient VBA code to help Steve dive into more stock analysis with faster results. We set up arrays and an improved for loop in order to make the code run more efficiently.

We were also able to reduce the the time it took for Steve to run his analysis.

These were a bit more efficent than the results from the original code that we put in for Steve in the Green Stocks Analysis.
## Summary
### 1. What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?
Some advantages of refactoring the code would be it lookd cleaner so it is easier to read. And also, the improved code can make the analysis quicker. If you're working with a large dataset, then it is important that the code is efficient. 

Some disadvantages to refactoring code, would be that there could be new errors or bugs within the code that you will need to fix. Which is why it is important to always commit to GitHub so you can make sure you don't mess something up and create a code that makes the analysis worse. 
### 2. How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?
These changes did indeed speed up the process and given that we included arrays, it does look a bit cleaner within the for loop for the refactored VBA script. Eventually I got the code to work, and had to old code saved in a different module to check against and could use that (in real life) if I had to.
